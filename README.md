# Snake Game

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my first game project: a classic Snake game developed using C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This project showcases my initial steps into game development, focusing on fundamental programming concepts, efficient data management, and interactive gameplay.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Developed using C++
- Utilizes Data Structures & Algorithms for efficient data handling
- Interactive and engaging user experience
